### Description

Shows all active connections with respective programs along with their 'actual' icons, shows status and remote address (IP) that connection is been made. Comes with a neat popup of new connections made (check screen shot). i owe credit for some parts of the code to others; Ariel icon extractor and CyberAlert (thanks Guys).
 
### More Info
 
Due to user feedback i should mention that this program was done in XP professional i do not know if win9X or 2000 support these kind of commands i am working on a fix that will use API and support all windows formats. Also people that are saying it hangs on WinXP the program may hang on "bSuccess = ReadFile(hReadPipe, mybuff, Len(mybuff), bytesread, 0&)" due to the size and number of connections, patients is a virtue and it will work just make sure to disable automatic refresh at design time. thank, update will appear on planetsourcecode in a number of days.
